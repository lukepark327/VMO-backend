# VMO-backend

Blockchain-based backend for VMO homepage.
Based on [`onechain`](https://github.com/lukepark327/onechain).

## New features

### Add new block
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/mineBlock
curl -H "Content-type:application/json" --data "{\"category\" : \"people\", \"data\" : [\"Anything you want\", \"Anything you need\"]}" http://127.0.0.1:3001/mineBlock
```

### Get blocks of particular category
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/category/:filter
```

For example, let us get blocks whose category is "people":

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/category/people
```

## Live Demo

[![Run on Ainize](https://ainize.ai/static/images/run_on_ainize_button.svg)](https://ainize.web.app/redirect?git_repo=github.com/lukepark327/onechain)

Run onechain on **Ainize**! You can access the *live* onechain with the [endpoint](https://endpoint.ainize.ai/lukepark327/onechain) provided by Ainize, a serverless platform for open-source projects.
For example, you can see all blocks in blockchain with a `/blocks` GET request (i.e. [HERE](https://endpoint.ainize.ai/lukepark327/onechain/blocks)) .

A **`onechain explorer`** is the front-end used to visualize the state of the blockchain. This blockchain explorer allows users to see the latest blocks and details about a particular block. onechain already has multiple functions with HTTP (RESTful API) endpoints. So the web page calls those endpoints and visualizes the results.

The full UI code is located in [lukepark327/onechain-explorer](https://github.com/lukepark327/onechain-explorer) repo. Vue.js and Vuetify are used.

# Abstract
![structure](https://github.com/lukepark327/onechain/blob/master/images/structure.png)

As Blockchain-based services grew, so open-source that assists in developing blockchain core was needed. There are open-source projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but those are too hard to learn and to use.

We solve the above problems with a
**```onechain```, simple implementation of blockchain core.**
The onechain adopts modular design: Dividing layers into blockchain, network, APIs, and wallet for clarity. Also, detailed comments and documents are provided to facilitate learning and reusing. Both front-end and back-end of onechain is written in Javascript (Node.js and Vue.js) but written in simple (without async, et al.) so that other language developers can understand them.

# Docker Quick Start

```bash
docker run -it -p 3001:3001 -p 6001:6001 lukepark327/onechain
```

# How to Start

## Environments
- Node.js v8.11.3
- cURL 7.55.1 *or* Postman v6.4.4

## Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
## Run Nodes

### Start node #1
```bash
npm start
```

### Start node #2

* Set `HTTP_PORT` for HTTP communication

  ```$env:HTTP_PORT=3002```
  *or*
  ```export HTTP_PORT=3002```

* Set `P2P_PORT` for P2P communication among peers

  ```$env:P2P_PORT=6002```
  *or*
  ```export P2P_PORT=6002```

* (*option*) Set pre-connected `PEERS` before running

  ```$env:PEERS="ws://127.0.0.1:6001[, ws://127.0.0.1:6003, ...]"```
  *or*
  ```export PEERS="ws://127.0.0.1:6001[, ws://127.0.0.1:6003, ...]"```

* (*option*) Set `PRIVATE_KEY` where private_key is located

  ```$env:PRIVATE_KEY="second"```
  *or*
  ```export PRIVATE_KEY="second"```

  Now private_key is located in `./wallet/second/` instead of default location `./wallet/default/`.

```bash
npm start
```

### Get blockchain
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/blocks
```

Use 'pretty-print JSON' for better readability:
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/blocks | python -m json.tool
```
Python >= 2.6 is required.

### Get a particular block
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/block/:number
```

For example, let us get a block whose number (index) is 3:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/block/3
```

### Add new block
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/mineBlock
curl -H "Content-type:application/json" --data "{\"category\" : \"people\", \"data\" : [\"Anything you want\", \"Anything you need\"]}" http://127.0.0.1:3001/mineBlock
```

### Get blocks of particular category
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/category/:filter
```

For example, let us get blocks whose category is "people":

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/category/people
```

### Get current version
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/version
```

### Get the version of particular block
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/blockVersion/:number
```

For example, let's get a version of a block whose number (index) is 3:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/blockVersion/3
```

### Get connected peer(s)
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/peers
```

### Add peer(s)
```bash
curl -H "Content-type:application/json" --data "{\"peers\" : [\"ws://127.0.0.1:6002\", \"ws://127.0.0.1:6003\"]}" http://127.0.0.1:3001/addPeers
```

### Get Address
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/address
```

### Stop
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/stop
```
